                <div>
                    It provides the same opportunities to amateur tennis players that are available to the professionals - namely, to find other tennis players to simply play a friendly game with or compete against. 
                    Its purpose is to create and maintain an amateur tennis league, and even grow into an association that ensures the presence of the competitive spirit in the game - a very essential part of any competitive sport - as well as makes the communication between players easier and provides opportunities for amateur tennis players to meet.
